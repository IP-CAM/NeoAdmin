# NeoAdmin - Admin Template for Opencart
## by Intersect - http://intersect.com.br

This template is made as an alternative to the original Admin Template from Opecart [www.opencart.com].
The idea is to have a more intuitive and pleasant experience managing a Opencart store.
This template has been developed using the Zurb's Foundation Framework [http://foundation.zurb.com], it is responsive and mobile first, but the mobile version isn't finished yet (too many tables...) and will be much more improved.

It was made only for the 1.5.5.1 version.

THIS IS A BETA! USE IT IN YOUR OWN RISK!!! IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA TO USE IT IN PRODUCTION STORES YET.

You can use and modify it as you wish in non-profit and commercial works. You CAN'T say it was made for you or sell it.

## INSTALLATION

1. Send all the files from the "upload" folder to your Opencart's installation, overriding all the files (it just override the admin's theme files and nothing more).

2. Login and test.

## ATTENTION

This template override almost every file from the original Admin's template, if you've made any alteration to the template, it'll be lost. No native module should have any problem with it, but some vQmods that modfy in anyway the administration can have problems because of the some modifications to the original template.
With some minor adjustments those vQmods shall work.
